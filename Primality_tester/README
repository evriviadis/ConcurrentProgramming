CONCURRENT PROGRAMING - ASSIGNMENT SERIES 1 - PRIMALITY TESTER

DESCRIPTION
This program takes positive integers as input and checks if they are prime or not. What's special about this, is that main doesn't execute the tests.
Instead, it assigns them to N worker threads that have been created to serve her. In that way, the analysis becomes faster. Threads can check none, one or many
numbers for primality it depends on main's assignments, on how fast a thread finishes and if there are many threads available to test numbers concurrently.
 

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
Programming language: C
Operating System: Linux
Compiler: GCC


COMPILATION PROCESS
Ensure GCC is instaled:  sudo apt-get install gcc
Compile the program:
    On a terminal go to the directory named Primality_tester.
    Compile with the command "make".
    Then, the executable file named "primality_tester" is created.
 

RUNNING PROCESS
Run the program with this command: ./primality_tester N < <file>
Create a file that contains positive integers seperated with ' ' or '\n'. 
Output is displayed on screen (stdout) and depicts if a number is prime (1)
or if it not (0).


TEST CASES
To test the correctness - performance of our program we run it for small and big numbers.
